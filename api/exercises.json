If that's still easy for you, raise one foot off the floor and the opposing hand at the same time. If you're in the gym you can also try weighted planks by adding weight plates to your back for additional resistence. Just make sure you do not let your midsection sag throughout the exercise.\n",

It is a very common movement that even the newest of beginner lifters have probably tried before.\nMost ab workouts include the ab crunch as it is thought to be one of the best core building exercises. However, instead of performing marathon sets of ab crunches, it is best to pair it with other ab movements such as the plank and hanging leg raise to get a complete ab workout.\nThe ab crunch replaced the sit up as the corner stone ab exercise. This is because people believed the sit up involved too much flexion which lends itself to lower back pain. Thus, it was replaced by the ab crunch, which accomplished the same movement pattern without overextending the spine.\nSome may still experience low back pain performing the ab crunch. If this is the case, it is best to stick with ab exercises that focus more on stability and less on flexion such as the plank.\n",

                        "firstContent": "The barbell bench press is a classic exercise popular among all weight lifting circles. From bodybuilders to powerlifters, the bench press is a staple chest exercise in nearly every workout program.\nFor powerlifters, it is known as one of the “big three” lifts which includes the squat, deadlift, and bench press. For athletes, 1 rep max on bench press is a good indicator for on field/court performance. And for bodybuilders, the bench press is a compound exercise that targets many of the muscles in your upper body.\nBy performing the bench press, you primarily work your pectoralis major (your chest). Other muscles which assist in moving the barbell during a bench press are other muscles of the chest, triceps, and shoulders.\nNot everyone is built to perform the traditional barbell bench press, so several variations have been created to ensure people can train this crucial movement pattern in a safe and comfortable way.\nSome of these variations include:\n\n\nIncline bench press\n\nDecline bench press,\n\nDumbbell bench press\n\nDumbbell incline bench press\n\nDumbbell decline bench press\n\nSmith machine bench press\n\nThose with shoulder injuries can also utilize many of the alternative barbells out there that place less pressure on the shoulder to bench press. Some of these variations include hex bar bench press, football bar bench press, and Swiss bar bench press.\n",

It is popular across numerous weight lifting circle including bodybuilders, powerlifts, and Crossfit athletes.\nThe deadlift focuses on lifting dead weight off the ground to hip level without using momentum to assist the weight on its path up. It is known as one of the “big three” exercises for powerlifters which includes squats, bench press, and the deadlift. Bodybuilders use the deadlift to promote muscle growth in their entire posterior chain (muscles on the back of the body).\nThe deadlift primarily works the muscles of the hamstrings. However, it is a complete compound exercise and also requires muscle activation from the back, glutes, hamstrings, arms, and core.\nThe conventional deadlift shouldn’t be performed by just anyone as it involves a lot of technique and skill to execute. However, the hip-hinge movement pattern trained while performing a deadlift is and should be included in every workout program.\nFor those who cannot deadlift using the conventional pulling method, they can perform the exercise using one of the many deadlift variations out there.\nSome of these deadlift variations include:\n\n\nTrap Bar Deadlift\n\nRomanian Deadlift\n\nStiff Leg Deadlift\n\nLandmine Deadlift\n\nDumbbell Deadlift\n\nSmith Machine Deadlift\n\nGrip strength is key to being able to deadlift a lot of weight and there are several grip variations you can use while deadlifting including: an overhand grip, mixed grip, and the hook grip.\n",

A smart option, to increase training frequency and work on the movement pattern, would be to perform RDLs on your leg day and another deadlift variation on your back or pull days.\nThe hip hinge is a crucial movement pattern, so it is important to find a variation that is comfortable for you to perform (if able), and work on it.\nThe landmine implement provides a somewhat fixed movement pattern to take some of the stress of the stabilizing muscle groups to help emphasize hamstring usage and limit potential injuries from other variations.\nThe landmine RDL is best utilized during your leg workouts and/or full body workouts.\n",
