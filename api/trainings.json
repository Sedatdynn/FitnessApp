It is a very common movement that even the newest of beginner lifters have probably tried before.\nMost ab workouts include the ab crunch as it is thought to be one of the best core building exercises. However, instead of performing marathon sets of ab crunches, it is best to pair it with other ab movements such as the plank and hanging leg raise to get a complete ab workout.\nThe ab crunch replaced the sit up as the corner stone ab exercise. This is because people believed the sit up involved too much flexion which lends itself to lower back pain. Thus, it was replaced by the ab crunch, which accomplished the same movement pattern without overextending the spine.\nSome may still experience low back pain performing the ab crunch. If this is the case, it is best to stick with ab exercises that focus more on stability and less on flexion such as the plank.\n",
